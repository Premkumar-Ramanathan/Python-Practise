Learning about the syntaxes and writing your first program: In this section, you will learn how to use print statements in different ways.\n","2. Arithmetic operations: You will learn about operators and understand their working.\n","3. Operator precedence: You will learn how to solve expressions with multiple operators, that is, understand the precedence of one operator over the other.\n","4. Variable: You will understand why variables are used when we can simply perform computations with the help of operators.\n","5. How to take user input: You will learn how to take input from the user and take a step towards making more complex programs.\n","6. Data types and typecasting: You will learn how to identify which type of data a user has entered and how to convert that data type into your desired form. \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# Welcome to the first Program of python\n","print(\"Hello World\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"colab_type":"code","executionInfo":{"elapsed":673,"status":"ok","timestamp":1595831909024,"user":{"displayName":"Kyongsik Yun","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjQlO7uiqLkcFacWZpW47SbJ3da0rOiyuaMuQY9Ug=s64","userId":"13658684151536633281"},"user_tz":420},"id":"l4AG2I8sLbH0","outputId":"29827879-8253-4edf-9440-ab6406eafe93"},"outputs":[],"source":["# 1.
